Main stage separation at 1500 ft using black powder canisters: designed it on CAD< manufactured it, and tested stage separation numerous times on the ground



 Guided Recovery System: The RAM air parachute's lines are controlled by a set of wheel drums and stepper motors, allowing for precise in-and-out movement similar to how a skydiver maneuvers a parachute. I designed the complete deployment system, which includes the reefing process, pilot chute, and main chute deployment. Additionally, I conducted drop tests to validate the deployment sequence at a skydiving center.
